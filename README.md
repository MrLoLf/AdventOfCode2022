# :christmas_tree:Advent Of Code 2022 in [V Lang](https://github.com/vlang/v)

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I decided to take this year as an opportunity to learn [V](https://github.com/vlang/v). My goal will be to write simple, readable, and idiomatic Rust code as much as I can. I will be restricting myself to the standard library and try to get familiar with it.

I will also try to add basic comments explaining my approach.
